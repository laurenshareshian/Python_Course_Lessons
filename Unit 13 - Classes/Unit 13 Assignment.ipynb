    "Data structures like lists and strings are extremely useful, but sometimes they aren’t enough to represent something you’re trying to implement. For example, let’s say we needed to keep track of a bunch of pets. We could represent a pet using a list by specifying the first element of the list as the pet’s name and the second element of the list as the pet’s species. This is very arbitrary and nonintuitive, however – how do you know which element is supposed to be which?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes give us the ability to create more complicated data structures that contain arbitrary content. We can create a Pet class that keeps track of the name and species of the pet in usefully named attributes called name and species, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into creating a class itself, we need to understand an important distinction. A class is something that just contains structure – it defines how something should be laid out or structured, but doesn’t actually fill in the content. For example, a Pet class may say that a pet needs to have a name and a species, but it will not actually say what the pet’s name or species is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where instances come in. An instance is a specific copy of the class that does contain all of the content. For example, if I create a pet polly, with name \"Polly\" and species \"Parrot\", then polly is an instance of Pet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can sometimes be a very difficult concept to master, so let’s look at it from another angle. Let’s say that the government has a particular tax form that it requires everybody to fill out. Everybody has to fill out the same type of form, but the content that people put into the form differs from person to person. A class is like the form: it specifies what content should exist. Your copy of the form with your specific information if like an instance of the class: it specifies what the content actually is.\n",

    "### Line 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic line for creating a class. The first word, class, indicates that we are creating a class. The second word, Pet, indicates the name of the class. Notice that the names of classes are ALWAYS capitalized, and that variables always start with a lowercase letter. This is so a programmer can easily tell the two apart. The word in parentheses, object, is the class that Pet is inheriting from. We’ll get more into inheritance below, so for now all you need to know is that object is a special variable in Python that you should include in the parentheses when you are creating a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines 3-5\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a new pet, we need to initialize (that is, specify) it with a name and a species. The __init__ method (method is just a special term for functions that are part of a class) is a special Python function that is called when an instance of a class is first created. For example, when running the code polly = Pet(\"Polly\", \"Parrot\"), the __init__ method is called with values polly, \"Polly\", and \"Parrot\" for the variables self, name, and species, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self variable is the instance of the class. Remember that instances have the structure of the class but that the values within an instance may vary from instance to instance. So, we want to specify that our instance (self) has different values in it than some other possible instance. That is why we say self.name = name instead of Pet.name = name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that the __init__ method (as well as other methods in the Pet class) have this self variable, but that when you call the method (e.g. polly = Pet(\"Polly\", \"Parrot\")), you only have to pass in two values. Why don’t we have to pass in the self parameter? This phenomena is a special behavior of Python: when you call a method of an instance, Python automatically figures out what self should be (from the instance) and passes it to the function. In the case of __init__, Python first creates self and then passes it in. We’ll talk a little bit more about this below when we discuss the getName and getSpecies methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines 7-11\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define methods to get the contents of the instance. The getName method takes an instance of a Pet as a parameter and looks up the pet’s name. Similarly, the getSpecies method takes an instance of a Pet as a parameter and looks up the pet’s species. Again, we require the self parameter so that the function knows which instance of Pet to operate on: it needs to be able to find out the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, we don’t actually have to pass in the self parameter because Python automatically figures it out. To make it a little bit clearer as to what is going on, we can look at two different ways of calling getName. The first way is the standard way of doing it: polly.getName(). The second, while not conventional, is equivalent: Pet.getName(polly). Note how in the second example we had to pass in the instance because we did not call the method via the instance. Python can’t figure out what the instance is if it doesn’t have any information about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines 13-14\n",
    "\n",
    "This __str__ method (often called toString) is a special function that is defined for all classes in Python (you have have noticed that methods beginning and ending with a double underscore are special). You can specify your own version of any built-in method, known as overriding the method. By overriding the __str__ method specifically, we can define the behavior when we try to print an instance of the Pet class using the print keyword.\n",

We also need to call the parent class initialization function, though, because we still want the name and species fields to be initialized. If we did not have line 4, then we could still call the methods getName and getSpecies.
