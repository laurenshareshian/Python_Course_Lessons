Then use a double for-loop to create the Cards (by calling the initializing method of the Card Class) and add them to the list. Consider testing this part before moving on to writing the methods. To help, here are three lists that you can use in your coding below:\n",

The attributes we will need are a single Deck object, and two lists that correspond to the player's hand and the computer's hand. We will also need methods as follows (notice that they are named so that anyone will know what they do): player_turn(), computer_turn(), deal(), hand_value(), check_bust(), find_winner(), and finally a main method to control the order of when methods will be called.
