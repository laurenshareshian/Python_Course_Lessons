These are Jupyter Notebook lessons that I've to teach Python at Oregon Episcopal School. They are a work in progress. You can run these locally if you download Anaconda or you can distribute them to students via the web through Google's Colaboratory or CoCalc (related to SageMath). 

Each unit typically follows this format:

The students have approximately one week to work through the assignment module at their own pace.

Then they work on a trickier problem set together.

Then they take a quiz (for the earlier units) or do a project (for the later units).


To write these units, I drew on inspiration from:
1. Chuck Severance's open resource book: https://www.py4e.com/book.php
2. Eric Matthes' Intro to Programming Notebooks: https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming
3. Grok Learning: https://groklearning.com/ 
4. Michael Kennedy's Talk Python To Me Courses: https://training.talkpython.fm/courses
5. Allen Downey's Think Stats book: http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/
