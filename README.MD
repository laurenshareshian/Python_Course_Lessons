These are Jupyter Notebook lessons that I'll be using to teach Python at my Oregon Episcopal School. They are a work in progress. Originally, I put these up on a web server so that my students could access them at www.portlandpython.com . Thanks to Jess Hamrick for her description of how to do it here: https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/deploying-jupyterhub-for-education/  and for her repo https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-teaching. However, I have been using www.cocalc.com this year for student access and it has been working pretty well (it does get buggy sometimes.) 

Each unit typically follows this format:

The students have approximately one week to work through the assignment module at their own pace.

Then they work on a trickier problem set together.

Then they take a quiz (for the earlier units) or do a project (for the later units).


To write these units, I drew on inspiration from:
1. Chuck Severance's open resource book: https://www.py4e.com/book.php
2. Eric Matthes' Intro to Programming Notebooks: https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming
3. Grok Learning: https://groklearning.com/ 
4. Michael Kennedy's Talk Python To Me Courses: https://training.talkpython.fm/courses
5. Allen Downey's Think Stats book: http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/


As we finish each unit this year and I work out the kinks, I will move the unit from "Rough Draft" to the main page.
