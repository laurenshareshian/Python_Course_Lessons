    "## Hackathon #3: Fewest Prime Dollar Words\n",

    "### You will do this problem on your own laptop, NOT in CoCalc\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Scrabble$^{TM}$, we have easy access to a list of almost all the possible words in the English language.  In this problem, you will access this list of over 260,000 words to find some very unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, your program will read the entire SOWPODS list of acceptable Scrabble$^{TM}$ words.  Then your program will calculate the **Dollar Value** of each word.  The **Dollar Value** of a word is determined like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Letter A=$26, letter B=$25, letter C=$24 ... letter Z=$1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example: kanye is worth $79 because \n",
    "    k 16\n",
    "    a 26\n",
    "    n 13\n",
    "    y 2\n",
    "    e 22\n",
    "    sum=79\n",
    "    \n",
    "Interestingly, **Kanye**'s dollar value ($79) is also a prime number.  Your job is to search the entire SOWPODS list of words and find which prime number value between 175 dollars and 275 dollars has the **Fewest** words associated with it.  Then print those words.  If you finish early, write a Haiku using at least one of those words.\n",

    "Make sure you **MAKE A PLAN** and **DIVIDE THE WORKLOAD** before you start coding.\n",
